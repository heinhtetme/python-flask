Syntax
________________________________________
1.	The most important thing with SQL syntax is to end your statements with a SEMI-COLON ;. SQL will not understand when you have finished your statement unless it sees that.
2.	You also MUST make sure to put all text strings in single quotes ', not double quotes. SQL views double quotes as a name of a table and single quotes as a string.


DDL vs DML
________________________________________
When working with SQL, the commands you will be using fall into two major categories:
DDL - Data Definition Language - this refers to the SQL syntax and commands around creating, modifying and deleting tables, columns and databases.
DML - Data Manipulation Language - this refers to the SQL syntax and commands around creating, reading, modifying and deleting rows.

Creating and Modifying data (DML)
________________________________________
When we perform CRUD operations on our rows (not columns, tables or databases) we are using DML or Data Manipulation Language.
CRUD	SQL
Create	INSERT
Read	SELECT
Update	UPDATE
Delete	DELETE
